What is the total number of sales?
What is the average sales per month? 
What is the monthly revenue?
What are the key demographics of the customers?
Which market (country) generated the most sales on average?
What were the profits by segment?
When were the best- and worst-selling periods?
Which products sell best? 
Which products should the company order more or less of?
How should the company adjust its marketing strategies to VIP customers and less-engaged ones?
Should the company acquire new customers, and how much money should they spend on it?
